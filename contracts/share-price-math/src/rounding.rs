//! Deterministic rounding policy for vault share conversions.
//!
//! The vault must never round in the user's favour: rounding always leaves the
//! residual dust with the vault, so `deposit -> withdraw` round trips can never
//! mint value out of nothing.
//!
//! | Operation  | Direction | Rounding |
//! |------------|-----------|----------|
//! | `deposit`  | assets to shares | [`Rounding::Down`] |
//! | `mint`     | shares to assets | [`Rounding::Up`]   |
//! | `withdraw` | assets to shares | [`Rounding::Up`]   |
//! | `redeem`   | shares to assets | [`Rounding::Down`] |
//!
//! [`FIXTURES`] is the canonical cross-language conformance table. The same
//! vectors are published as `fixtures/rounding_fixtures.json` so that the
//! TypeScript SDK and the backend quote service can assert byte-identical
//! results against this implementation.
